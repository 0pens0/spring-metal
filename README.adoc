# Demo of AI/LLM with Tanzu 

This repo contains artifacts to build and run GenAI apps with Spring Boot and Tanzu

## cf runtime - external back-end services

```
cf target -o ai-apps -s ai-spring-metal

cf create-service private-ai-service shared-ai-plan ai-service

cf create-service postgres on-demand-postgres-db pgvector

cf push
```

## k8s runtime

```
**make sure you use the latest versions of the Tanzu cli**

Make sure the space profile has ingress trait configured with Route53 domain and a secret was applied on the UCP for making changes to AWS. also make sure that the Egress trair has open == true to be able to connect to external services.
run the flollowing commands after creating the space based on the profile:

**build**

tanzu context use <my-context>
tanzu projectr use <my-project>
tanzu space use <my-space>

tanzu build -o build-output #this will build the code and consolidate the build output in this folder
tanzu deploy --from-build build-output #this will deploy from the folder we have just built

```
External service creation and binding

use the conf/.secert folder to configure the external services yaml files, there is a PreProvisionedService and Secret to configure with the connection details from the external service (TAS in this case)
after creating the services with kubectl to the space (UCP context) now we can bind them with the following commands:

tanzu service instance bind PreProvisionedService/<genaiservicename> ContainerApp/<appname> --as genai
tanzu services instance bind PostgreSQLInstance/<postgresname> ContainerApp/<appname> --as db

```
